This is a project for Udacity's React Nanodegree: React Native module. It was built using:
- Expo - set of tools, libraries and services which let you build native iOS and Android apps by writing JavaScript
- Redux - to manage application state
- React Navigation - to manage application navigation (tabs and stack)
- Formik - to manage form state and input handlers

It was tested using Expo on a Samsung Galaxy S8 and in an iPhone 7.
